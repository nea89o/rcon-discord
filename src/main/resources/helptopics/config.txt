{
  "rcon": {
    "server": "localhost",
    "port": 25575,
    "password": "Passwort1234"
  },
  "kickmessage": "Â§8HALLOHL",
  "whitelistfile": "/home/romangraef/mcserver1.12.2/",
  "selfinvite": true,
  "discord": {
    "welcomemessage": "ðŸ”® %s ist jetzt bei NoGravity mit dabei! Hurra!",

    "token": "TOKEN",
    "selfinviteroles": [
      "self invite roles"
    ],
    "bannedrole": "ONE SINGLE BAN ROLE"
  }
}```
the rcon parameters are set in the `server.properties` of your minecraft server.
the `whitelistfile` parameter is for setting the whitelist while being offline
turn on `selfinvite`if people other than admins should be able to link accounts (mostly wanted)
the `welcomemessage` is the only message that will be left to indicate who linked an account. use %s as replacement for the username
the `prefix` is the prefix for your bot
the `admins` are the roles who can use admin commands like `!unlink` (or `!link` if `selfinvite` is `false`). those are ids. see `help discord-ids`
the `token` is the token of your bot user. Seek help over at the [Discord Developer Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
the `selfinviteroles` are the roles who should be able to use `!link` (if `selfinvite` is `true`). Leave empty to ignore. those are ids. see `help discord-ids`
the `bannedrole` is a role which indicated that a user isn't allowed to register despite having the selfinviterole.

If you still have problems, see `help contact`
