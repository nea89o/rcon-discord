```
the rcon parameters are set in the `server.properties` of your minecraft server.
the `whitelistfile` parameter is for setting the whitelist while being offline
turn on `selfinvite`if people other than admins should be able to link accounts (mostly wanted)
the `welcomemessage` is the only message that will be left to indicate who linked an account. use %s as replacement for the username
the `prefix` is the prefix for your bot
the `admins` are the roles who can use admin commands like `!unlink` (or `!link` if `selfinvite` is `false`). those are ids. see `help discord-ids`
the `token` is the token of your bot user. Seek help over at the [Discord Developer Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
the `selfinviteroles` are the roles who should be able to use `!link` (if `selfinvite` is `true`). Leave empty to ignore. those are ids. see `help discord-ids`
the `bannedrole` is a role which indicated that a user isn't allowed to register despite having the selfinviterole.

If you still have problems, see `help contact`
