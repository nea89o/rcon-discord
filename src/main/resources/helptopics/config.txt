```json
{
  "rcon": {
    "server": "localhost",
    "port": 25575,
    "password": "Passwort1234"
  },
  "whitelistfile": "/path/to/your/minecraft/server",
  "selfinvite": true,
  "discord": {
    "welcomemessage": "%s has registered themselves.",
    "prefix": "!",
    "admins": [
      "310702108997320705"
    ],
    "token": "CENSORED",
    "selfinviteroles": [
      "ROLES"
    ]
  }
}```
the rcon parameters are set in the `server.properties` of your minecraft server.
the `whitelistfile` parameter is for setting the whitelist while being offline
turn on `selfinvite`if people other than admins should be able to link accounts (mostly wanted)
the `welcomemessage` is the only message that will be left to indicate who linked an account. use %s as replacement for the username
the `prefix` is the prefix for your bot
the `admins` are the persons who can use admin commands like `!unlink` (or `!link` if `selfinvite` is `false`). those are ids. see `help discord-ids`
the `token` is the token of your bot user. Seek help over at the [Discord Developer Page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
the `selfinviteroles` are the roles who should be able to use `!link` (if `selfinvite` is `true`). Leave empty to ignore. those are ids. see `help discord-ids`

If you still have problems, see `help contact`
